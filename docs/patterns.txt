1) Component A starts another component B through startXXX (e.g.,
startActivity).

Two cases:

1.1) Explicit Intents

===
 /* from component A */
 Intent i=new Intent (this, component /* to component B */);
 startActivity(i);
===

To handle this case it is necessary to analyze what are the possible
class objects that object "component" can refer to and then declare
communication.

1.2) Implicit Intents

===
 /* from component A */
 Intent i = new Intent (s);
 startActivity(i);
===

To handle this case it is important to analyze what are the possible
string objects that "s" can refer to and declare communication if
there are match the intent filters in the manifest file (presumably
there should be at least one matching component).  


2) Component A start another component by other means...

===
Intent i = new Intent();
...
i.setComponent(componentName);
...
===

or 

===
Intent i = new Intent();
...
i.setClass(c)
...
===

To handle these additional cases we propose to use read-write sets
algorithm at EXTRA keys.  

Question: should we use same approach for ACTION?  Maybe non-standard
actions?
