In Android, communication takes place when a component A starts
another component B, through a start method (e.g., startActivity).

1) Explicit Intents

===
 /* from component A */
 Intent i = new Intent (this, component /* to component B */);
 startActivity(i);
===

To handle this case it is necessary to analyze what are the possible
class objects that object "component" can refer to and then declare
communication.

2) Implicit Intents

===
 /* from component A */
 Intent i = new Intent (s);
 startActivity(i);
===

To handle this case it is important to analyze what are the possible
string objects that "s" can refer to and only declare communication if
a match of the intent filters (in the manifest file presumably there
should be at least one matching component) and a strings of s can be
found.
