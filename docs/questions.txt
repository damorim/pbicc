Considering that all Android communication manifests with variations
  of these two patterns (patterns.txt), why should we care about our
  current approach (read-write over extra data)?  

Is it because we are concerned that it is too hard to cover all
  special cases with one single approach?  

Considering pattern 1, the cases below look a bit different then what
  I described but they do not seem hard.  How many particular cases
  such as these exist?

===
Intent i = new Intent();
... 
i.setComponent(componentName); // ComponentName object passed as parameter
...
===

or this case:
===
Intent i = new Intent();
...
i.setClass(c)
...
===

Or you are concerned more with the pattern 2 as it can be challenging
to infer action from strings.  If yes, are these strings part of a
documented language?  In other words, can we find action if we can
find the strings?
