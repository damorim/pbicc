\section{Introduction (1 page)}

Android marketshare, numbers, importance. 
Briefly explaing that Android applications interact through intents and ICC

Discuss past analysis, how they often are built for soundness, and therefore suffer on scalability. Also mention about trying to capture each and every way of building intents and ICC

Explain that intents and ICC are built following patterns. Use a small example? We can explore this to create lightweight analysis, that are imprecise, but can account for most of the scenarios, as we show in the evaluation (hopefully). 

Brief idea of the solution. 

We make the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item We present a tool for computing Android ICC in a pattern-based way;
 \item We perform a study with $XX$ applications, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art analysis for detecting ICC~\cite{epicc,iccta,comdroid}
 \item something about client analysis here? \emph{We analyze the impact that our solution has on tools that perform taint analysis on Android applications...}
\end{itemize}
