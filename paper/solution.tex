\section{Solution (1-2 pages)}

Explain the idea of patterns using 1-2 concrete examples. (1 from motivation and maybe other here)

The intuition is that patterns can often occur together, therefore we
might calculate the intersection and give a precise answer over the
ICC specification in most of the program points.

\marcelo{I guess we need a background section on Android (to be shown
  earlier) that provides the grounds to discuss the following
  sections.}

\subsection{Explicit ICC}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Intent creation with class name (anonymous object)
 \item Use setComponent/setClass on Intent object
\end{itemize}

Both patterns can be specialized when the class name is in a local variable, static class attribute, and so on... Explain this.

\subsection{Implicit ICC}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Intent with get/put extras
 \item Intent with Action, Data, and Category fields
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic Broadcast Receivers}

Still working on which patterns we can establish for this case.


\subsection{Implementation}

Explain the overall implementation, we collect the information based on the patterns established above. 

Then we have to perform a ``join'' of this information, to make it more precise

This results in a number of ICC specifications, or interfaces. Explain the idea using the 1-2 examples given before.
