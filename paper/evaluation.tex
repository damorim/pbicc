Explicitly detail the environment in which we performed all of the analysis detailed below

\subsection{Quantitative Analysis}

Analysis on precision/recall of the specifications. 

\emph{Epicc evaluation consists of inferring specifications automatically, and if there is only ``one'' possible specification, they consider it precise. One way would be to adopt the same strategy for considering our precision/recall. }

\emph{I am going through FlowDroid~\cite{flowdroid} and Atanas' GATOR paper~\cite{analysis-callbacks-android}, to understand how they considered the ground truth.}

\subsection{Comparison with existing ICC tools}

Compare deltas with Epicc~\cite{epicc}, IC3~\cite{ic3-icse15}, ComDroid~\cite{comdroid}

\subsection{Application to Vulnerabilities}

Use IccTA~\cite{iccta} with our ICC information and compare performance and analysis results.
