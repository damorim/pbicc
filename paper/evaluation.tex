\section{Evaluation (4 pages)}

\marcelo{I suggest to think about the questions we want to answer
  first: I think it is a good idea to show purpose.  How the technique
  (name) performs in term of precision, recall, and efficiency?  What
  is the practical effect of the technique in a client analysis? (When
  there is loss, how relevant is it?  if not, why?)  The interesting
  question here seems to be: if this is for security, do attackers
  typically care about creating hard-to-find communication patterns?
  Would they care after reading our paper?  Btw., are there client
  analysis other than security (e.g., tainting)?}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\marcelo{The setup/methodology should go together with the experiment,
not separate.  Don't need to necessarily show independent/dependent variables etc. }

Explicitly detail the environment in which we performed all of the analysis detailed below

Discuss in which 

\subsection{Quantitative Analysis}

Analysis on precision/recall of the specifications. 

\emph{Epicc evaluation consists of inferring specifications
  automatically, and if there is only ``one'' possible specification,
  they consider it precise. One way would be to adopt the same
  strategy for considering our precision/recall. }\marcelo{I don't
  understand what exactly ``specification'' means here.  Is it the set of
  ground-truth component-to-component flows?  Even more 
  is to understand how they computed/obtained this set.  I can only imagine
  they did that manually but that would only work for small apps.  But
  if the metric recall is not taken into account then the problem is much easier.
  As the set of flows our analysis reports may not be outrageous, then
  it is even possible to inspect the output to measure precision (not
  recall).  In summary, there are two alternatives: (1) model set of
  flows for every app (to enable computation of precision and recall)
  and (2) inspect output of tool (to measure precision).  }

\emph{I am going through FlowDroid~\cite{flowdroid} and Atanas' GATOR paper~\cite{analysis-callbacks-android}, to understand how they considered the ground truth.}

\subsection{Comparison with existing ICC tools}

Compare deltas with Epicc~\cite{epicc}, IC3~\cite{ic3-icse15},
ComDroid~\cite{comdroid}\marcelo{is this another ICC tool? If so, also
explain in the beginning.}

\subsection{Application to Vulnerabilities}

Use IccTA~\cite{iccta} with our ICC information and compare performance and analysis results.
