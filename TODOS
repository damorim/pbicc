evaluation 

1. Compare results (time, precision, and recall) of Epicc and IC3 on a small (5-10) set of apps

features

1. Handle communication without extras
2. Handle communication through delegate classes
3. Handle non-literal constants (both for explicit and implicit intents).  May use constant-propagation from other project.
4. (While/If constant-propagation on keys is not done) Handle cases where keys are of the form "X.Y.Z".  Problems can arise when keys are accessed from different modules.  

test

- please add more tests; I added two tests after fixing a bug but please contribute to strength regression suite

design

- break mutual dependency between KeysPrinter and Main
- avoid unnecessary use of static
